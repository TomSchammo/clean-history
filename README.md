# Clean History

A deamon to automatically clean shell histories.

Having my shell history polluted by duplicate commands
or commands that are specific to a certain folder or file
that no longer exists is annoying.

So I decided to do something about it.

## Features


## Roadmap

- [ ] Support for Z-Shell
- [ ] Removal of duplicates
- [ ] Intelligent file tracking to remove any commands that access/
      interact with files that no longer exist
- [ ] Support for bash (maybe)
